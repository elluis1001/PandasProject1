# School District Analysis

This project analyzes the district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district. The analysis includes aggregating the data to showcase trends in school performance.

## Project Overview

As the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, you have been tasked with analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. The dataset includes every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data and identify trends in school performance to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Repository Structure

- `PyCitySchools/`
  - `PyCitySchools.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main script for analysis
- `Resources/`
  - `schools_complete.csv`: Dataset containing school information
  - `students_complete.csv`: Dataset containing student information

## Dataset

The datasets used in this analysis, `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv`, were generated by Mockaroo, LLC (2022) and edX Boot Camps LLC. The data is intended for educational purposes only.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following:

1. District Summary
   - Total number of unique schools
   - Total students
   - Total budget
   - Average math score
   - Average reading score
   - Percentage of students who passed math
   - Percentage of students who passed reading
   - Percentage of students who passed both math and reading

2. School Summary
   - School name
   - School type
   - Total students
   - Total school budget
   - Per student budget
   - Average math score
   - Average reading score
   - Percentage of students who passed math
   - Percentage of students who passed reading
   - Percentage of students who passed both math and reading

3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

5. Math Scores by Grade
   - Average math score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

6. Reading Scores by Grade
   - Average reading score for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

7. Scores by School Spending
   - School performance based on average spending ranges (per student)

8. Scores by School Size
   - School performance based on school size (small, medium, large)

9. Scores by School Type
   - School performance based on school type (district, charter)

## Observations and Insights

The analysis will include at least two observable trends based on the data.
